# Autoblind project

I decided to do this project because I was tired of closing and opening my blinds every day. I am using an ESP32 and ESPHome library to control a servo with Home Assisntant.

## Parts:

- ESP32-DevKitC-32E
- N-channel power MOSFET - IRLB8721
- 2kg 300 Clutch Servo
- 5.5 x 2.1 mm power jack socket
- 6V 2A power supply
